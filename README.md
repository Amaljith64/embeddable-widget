# Embeddable Widget

This is an Embeddable Widget that provides valuable SEO insights based on user-entered URLs. The widget is hosted on [railway.app](https://embeddable-widget-production.up.railway.app/).

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: I have created a user-friendly interface where users can input a URL. The interface is designed to be mobile-friendly for a seamless user experience.

- **Real-Time SEO Insights**: Upon entering a URL, the widget sends a request to the "DataForSEO" On-Page API with browser rendering enabled. It then displays the API response, including data on the URL's SEO performance.

- **Secure API Integration**: I have integrated the "DataForSEO" On-Page API according to the provided documentation ([DataForSEO API Documentation](https://docs.dataforseo.com/)). The API request is made securely with proper authentication.

- **Clean and Maintainable Code**: I have maintained a clean and well-organized codebase, adhering to best practices and coding standards. The code is easily understandable and maintainable.
